Forgot someone's name? No problem! This iPhone app, "Face to Name" will fill you in on the names of people you know.   

I wanted to learn iOS development and AWS (Amazon Web Services) skills so I decided to make an iPhone app that incorporates Swift programming and AWS's APIs.   

The app is written from 100% scratch and took about 2 full weeks of hard work. 

## Installing
Everything you need to run the project in xcode should be provided, included all AWS (Amazon Web Services) frameworks necessary.
